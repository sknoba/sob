### Key Feature Overview
The system will manage **all data by academic session (e.g., 2024-2025)** to ensure data separation and integrity. The application will include **backup, restore, and session management** capabilities, along with **role-based access control (RBAC)** and **permission-based access control (PBAC)** for different user types.

### Access Control & Security

#### 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Principal**: Full control over the system, including user management and permissions.
- **Management Staff**: Limited to administrative functions like admissions, fees, and student management.
- **Teachers**: Limited to academic tasks like attendance, marks entry, and report cards.

#### 2. **Permission-Based Access Control (PBAC)**
- Define custom permissions for specific actions (e.g., access to archived data, modifying attendance records, etc.).

---

### Data Management Flow

1. **Start New Academic Year**:
   - Principal or Management Staff can create a new academic session.
   - Option to copy selected data (like classes, subjects, and students) from the previous session.

2. **End of Academic Year**:
   - Archive the completed session's data for backup.
   - Download data for offline storage if needed.
   - Lock data from the previous year to prevent modifications.

3. **Backup & Restore**:
   - Scheduled backups of the current session data.
   - Restore functionality to bring back archived sessions without mixing data.

### Technical Implementation Suggestions

- **Framework**: Django for the backend with a PostgreSQL database for session-based data management.
- **Frontend**: Use AJAX and jQuery for dynamic interactions; DataTables for data listings.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Utilize Django's built-in authentication system along with the `django-guardian` or `django-rules` library for fine-grained permissions.
- **Session Management**: Create a separate database schema or tables for each academic year to isolate data.

This structure ensures a robust, modular, and scalable approach to managing a school's operations, with clear separation of data and access controls. Let me know if you need further customization or additional details on specific functionalities!
